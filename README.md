This project pops up a certain piece of text when you type up the correct password
in the input bar and click the submit button.

This project functions on a bunch of different function like click, hide and show. This
is also functioned on an id tag i used to identify the message that pops up when you click
the submit button, if you type in the correct password.

Things that i would add to this project if i had more time would be a bigger input bar,
a better background, and a more dramatic effect when you get the correct password.
